    "## Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to contribute to the development of a mobile app by writing a couple of functions that are mostly focused on calculating probabilities. The app is aimed to both prevent and treat lottery addiction by helping people better estimate their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app idea comes from a medical institute which is specialized in treating gambling addictions. The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that can answer users the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The original data set has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018, and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional — the main purpose is to practice applying probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combinatoric functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by writing two functions that we'll use often for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function that calculates factorials; and\n",
    "- A function that calculates combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. The drawing is done without replacement, which means once a number is drawn, it's not put back in the set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the correct number of possible outcomes from a drawing without replacement we'll use the formula for combinations which takes only k objects from a group of n possible objects."

For the first version of the app, we want players to be able to calculate the probability of winning the big prize with the various numbers they play on a single ticket (for each ticket a player chooses six numbers out of 49). So, we'll start by building a function that calculates the probability of winning the big prize for any given ticket.\n",

    "\n",
